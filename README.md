# PinPotha - Good Thoughts

This application helps you record and remember the good things you have done in your life. Later your mind will be happy after reading those good things which you have done.

The ancient people had a small book called 'PIN POTHA'. Which they used to record and memorize good things which they have done. But now this good habit has been gone from us. Most of the people use smartphones and web browsers these days, so we thought that if we can design apps for both Android and Web, it will be close to people in our era. We hope this app will bring back that good habit to our people.
